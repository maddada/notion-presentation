## Key Features

### Block-by-Block Reveal
Unveil your content one block at a time to keep your audience focused. Great for building suspense, explaining step-by-step processes, or guiding viewers through complex information.

### Clean, Minimal Interface
A subtle floating toolbar appears at the bottom of your screen with all controls at your fingertips. Hover over any button to see what it does and its keyboard shortcut.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Control everything without touching your mouse:

Alt + 1 | Go back (hide last block)
Alt + 2 | Go forward (reveal next block)
Alt + 3 | Toggle between presentation and full view
Alt + 4 | Reset (hide all blocks)
Alt + 5 | Expand all toggle blocks
Alt + 6 | Hide All Notion UI
(Use Option on macOS instead of Alt)

### Smart Empty Block Handling
Automatically skips over empty blocks, so your presentation flows smoothly without awkward pauses on blank lines.

### Expand Toggles Instantly
Have nested content in toggle blocks? Expand them all at once with a single click or keyboard shortcut.

### Persistent Progress
Your presentation progress is saved automatically. Refresh the page or come back later, and you'll pick up right where you left off.

## Privacy & Permissions

Notion Presenter only runs on Notion pages (notion.so and notion.site). It does not collect, store, or transmit any of your data. All presentation state is stored locally in your browser.

**Minimal permissions:**
- `storage` - To remember your preferences
- `activeTab` - To communicate with the current Notion page when you click the extension

That's it. No background processes, no data collection, no access to other websites.
