No more switching between apps. Write your content in Notion, present it beautifully.

## Key Features

### Block-by-Block Reveal
Unveil your content one block at a time to keep your audience focused. Great for building suspense, explaining step-by-step processes, or guiding viewers through complex information.

### Clean, Minimal Interface
A subtle floating toolbar appears at the bottom of your screen with all controls at your fingertips. Hover over any button to see what it does and its keyboard shortcut.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Control everything without touching your mouse:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt/Option + 1` | Go back (hide last block) |
| `Alt/Option + 2` | Go forward (reveal next block) |
| `Alt/Option + 3` | Toggle between presentation and full view |
| `Alt/Option + 4` | Reset (hide all blocks) |
| `Alt/Option + 5` | Expand all toggle blocks |

### Smart Empty Block Handling
Automatically skips over empty blocks, so your presentation flows smoothly without awkward pauses on blank lines.

### Expand Toggles Instantly
Have nested content in toggle blocks? Expand them all at once with a single click or keyboard shortcut.

### Persistent Progress
Your presentation progress is saved automatically. Refresh the page or come back later, and you'll pick up right where you left off.
